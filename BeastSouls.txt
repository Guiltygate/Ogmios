				
				Proposed Rulset "Beast Souls"

	Combat is grid-based and turn-based, but takes place in "real-time". The PC
	and every NPC take a turn in order, based on a listing sorted by the
	Reflex and Snout stats, but time does not pause for actions to be taken.
	So to the player, the combat feels like real-time, but behind the scenes,
	each character action is happening in a certain order, at a certain time,
	with no discernable wait. Of course, the downside is if the player fails
	to react in time, and every other character takes an action.

	To help relieve this, each action takes a certain amount of time based on
	the animation, and also costs stamina to use. Total stamina and stamina
	regen are based off of the Lung and Blood stats respectively.

	It's worth noting that, IF it doesn't prove too complex balance-wise, a 
	non-grid system may be implemented. Easy to implement, but may make system
	unstable?


	Major Stats
		Muscle		Physical strength. Used for Intimidation, Melee Hit / Damage.
		Reflex		Physical reflexes. Used for Ranged Hit, dodging attacks.
		Lung		Denotes max stamina, along with aiding Singing (Hymns) and Chanting (Rituals)
		Instinct	How in touch with nature a character is, denotes shamanistic skill (Rituals)
		Mind		Dictates ability to remember complex patterns (Hexes) and academic skills.
		Snout		Perception / Awareness. Used for tracking, dodging.
		Aura		How in touch with the world a character is, denotes concentration (Hymns)
		Blood		Used for stamina regen along with HP. Similar to Vitality?
		Fur			Charisma, plain and simple. Convince/Persuade.
		Paw			Dexterity of paws. Used for lockpicking, alchemy work, anything hand-related.

		Each stat score is the number of six-sided die rolled for that stat.

		
	Current thoughts for leveling are:

		Each character starts with a max of 30 pts, maxed at 5(ish) per stat.

		Every time a character uses a stat (makes a check), they gain XP based on
		the difficulty of the check.

		XP gained = Obstacle - stat [- other relevant stats ] [- mods ]

		So if the obstacle is difficult, but the player has a bunch of helpful
		mods and stats, the XP gained is lower than if the player had fewer
		mods. So the more difficult a check is, the better, especially since the
		character doesn't have to succeed.

		Abuse of this is curbed by the fact the player's time is limited- they
		can't keep making checks over and over without giving up time that could
		be spent on other things, or exhausting their party members.

=========================== Side Note ===================================================
	Each character regains all HP at the end of a battle, but the HP
	lost during battle contributes to a 'fatigue meter' that is persistent. Fatigue
	only restores based on the number of "arcs" spent resting. The world works on a 
	time scale of 8 arcs a day, 1 arc for 3 hours. 3 game hours = 1 arc = 8 real world minutes.
	So the conversion is 1 game hour = ~2.75 real minutes (ignore rounding). It has to be fast,
	since I wanted the game to be 3 months long... which would be 90 hours
	( but you can skip time! )
	Thought on this would also be appreciated.
==================================================================================================

		Checks that include multiple stats work as expected, with both gaining
		a small amount of XP.

		Needed checks to increase stat: Stat X -> Stat Y requires X * 10 XP. 
		E.g. increasing Reflex 1 to Reflex 2 requires 10 points. 2 -> 3, 20 points.
		Not sure if linear is the right way to go, exponential is more typical?
		Have any thoughts on this?

		Haven't worked out the math yet, but Stat XP gain is granted bonuses
		from Roles. Each character starts with a Role, and can gain additional ones
		by spending time in battle with NPCs that have the desired Role. You can "link"
		units in battle, allowing them to fight and flank more efficiently. Basically 
		makes them target the same enemy (usually) and builds relationships.

		Roles provide the afore-mentioned XP gain increase (small, but noticeable), 
		along with Teachings, which are anything that grant a passive bonus in or out of
		combat.

		E.g. the Knight Role has the Noble Teaching, which grants +1 Muscle when linked
		with an NPC that is Bleeding (below 50% HP)


		Obviously this is just sketches right now, needs a lot of work. I'm skipping the player's
		ability to grant some of their powers to their followers (since you're a Savior). that'll
		come later.

		Below are a couple sample characters that might become party members. If you can pick three,
		I'll make their sprites and animations for battle testing first, and I'll probably bully you
		into helping me revise their designs. You might recognize a few faces from the sandbox ;)

		Name	Sex		Weapon/Trademark	Species		Role

		Aarone	M		Talisman, Iron Mask Mouse		Clay Shaman
		Kit 	F		Umbrella, 			Fox			Waif
		Shione	F		Rod 				Mole 		Witch
		Belth	M		Medical Kit 		Mouse 		Physician
		Barra 	F		Flamberge 			Badger 		Beast
		Vongar	M 		Rod 				Badger 		Ash Shaman
		Pierre	M 		Rapier 				Hedgehog 	Duelist
		Cor 	M 		Longsword 			Wolf 		Knight
		Ilsa 	F 		Rifle 				Hare 		Scout/Sniper
		Torren 	M 		Fist 				Hare 		Drunk
		Jamon 	M 		Lash 				Mole 		Pilgrim
		Meina 	F 		Stilleto 			Mouse 		Assassin

		Or suggest another, I'm open.
