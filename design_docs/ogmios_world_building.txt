This won't be directly told to the player.

The Pale One, a human bio-engineer, creates 7 new species, each genetically based off of humanity.
Each is named jokingly after a previous animal race.

	Mouse	-	furry, 5 large petal-like ears come from their neck.)
	Badger	-	large, muscular, four large horns present on male heads.
	Hedgehog-	
	Hare	-	Not much has changed, but thinner and prone to run towards enemies rather than away.
	Wolf	-	Sports a 
	Fox		-	
	Mole	-	

The Pale One brings the forefathers of the races to life and raises them in Ur, named after the Cradle from
human history.

He briefly instructs some of them, once old enough, in how to manage the nanites and racial conciousness.
As time passes, some of the tribes develop community roles around these.

	Shamans are those who work with Nature to change the landscape and develop golems.
		Terraforming and artificial life are products of the nanites, which are manipulated by the Shamans via (thought).
		Takes Stamina.

	Witches are those who force souls to do their bidding, cursing and harming others.
		This is done by the Witches drawing complex patterns, which instruct any present nanites to what functions
		are required of them.

	Hymnists heal and soothe others, going to double-check when I get back.
